Prowl: http://prowl.weks.net/

PHP-Prowl is small class that allows you to send push notifications to your iPhone using your Prowl account.

Before using this class you'll need three things: 

* an Iphone (obviously...)
* the Prowl app from the App Store, and
* a Prowl account

Example usage can be found in example.php
